# Library Management API Project

## Overview

Your task is to design and implement a RESTful API for managing books and users in a library system. The API should include endpoints for listing, adding, updating, and deleting books.

## Features

- Book Listing: Users should be able to list all books available in the library.
- Book Addition: Users should be able to add new books to the library.
- Book Update: Admin should be able to update existing book information.
- Book Deletion: Admin should be able to delete books from the library.
- User Management: Implement basic user management functionalities (e.g., registration, authentication).
- Book Borrowing and Returning: Add functionalities for users to borrow and return books.
- User Profile: Provide endpoints for users to view and update their profile information.

## Optional Tasks (Must Choose 2-3)

1. **Book Search:** Implement search functionality to allow users to search for books by title, author, or category.
2. **Book Categories:** Allow books to be categorized by genre or subject for easier navigation.
3. **Book Availability:** Show the availability status of each book (e.g., available, borrowed, reserved).
4. **Fine Management:** Implement functionalities for tracking fines and penalties for late book returns.

## Technologies

- Backend: Design a microservice architecture. Use gRPC for communication between services. You are free to choose frameworks and languages.
- Database: Utilize a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing book and user data.
- Containerization: Dockerize the application for easy deployment and scalability. Create a docker compose for whole project.

## Documentation

Document the API design, including the following:

- Overview of services and their functionalities.
- Request and response formats (including status codes) using swagger or redoc is preferred.
- Authentication mechanisms.
- Setup and deployment instructions.
- Any assumptions made and challenges faced during development.

## Instructions

1. Use git!
2. Choose the backend technologies you will use.
3. Design and implement the RESTful API according to the specified requirements.
4. Implement the chosen optional tasks to enhance the API's functionality.
5. Write tests for your code.
6. If applicable, provide instructions for setting up and testing the API.
7. **Documentation** is a must, also git it.
8. Be prepared to discuss your API design choices and any improvements you would make.
9. Make the repository public and share it.
